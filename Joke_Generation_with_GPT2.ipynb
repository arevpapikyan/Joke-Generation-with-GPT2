All we ever see up there are logging trucks.\\n\\nThis morning all of the guys were diving off the rocks and swimming out in the lake. \\n\\nScoutmaster Webb wouldnt let me because I cant swim and Chad was afraid he would sink because of his cast, so he let us take the canoe across the lake. \\nIt was great. You can still see some of the trees under the water from the flood.\\n\\nScoutmaster Webb isnt crabby like some scoutmasters. He didnt even get mad about us not wearing the life jackets.\\n\\nHe has to spend a lot of time working on the car so we are trying not to cause him any trouble.\\n\\nGuess what? We all passed our first aid merit badges and when Dave dove in the lake and cut his arm we got to see how a tourniquet works.\\n\\nAlso Wade and I threw up. Scoutmaster Webb said it probably was just food poisoning from the leftover chicken.\\n\\nHe said they got sick that way with the food they ate in prison. \\n\\nIm so glad he got out and become our scoutmaster. He said he sure figured out how to get things done better while he was doing his time.\\n\\nI have to go now. Were going into town to mail our letters and buy bullets. Dont worry about anything.

Anybody who was anybody wanted to reside in Perfect Cheerio World, but unfortunately only the lucky few got the honor of living in Perfect Cheerio World. In Nonperfect Cheerio World there was a Cheerio named Joe. Nonperfect Cheerio Joe was a regular person just like you and me. Day in and day out though he wished for a better world to live in. He believed he deserved the chance to experience Perfect Cheerio World because he worked his Cheerio butt off 247.\\n\\nOne night when Nonperfect Cheerio Joe was on his way home from work, a Cheerio Genie visited him. The Cheerio Genie had noticed Nonperfect Cheerio Joes constant dedication to his job, friends, and family and thought that he deserved a little loving himself. The Cheerio Genie allowed Nonperfect Cheerio Joe to have one wish. Nonperfect Cheerio Joe wished that he could go to Perfect Cheerio World for a day. The Cheerio Genie, being the good cheerio that he is, granted Nonperfect Cheerio Joe his wish.\\n\\n\\nCome Saturday morning after a long week at the office, Nonperfect Cheerio Joe awoke in a place unfamiliar to him. He knew immediately that he was in Perfect Cheerio World. A Perfect Cheerio soon approached him. Oh how Nonperfect Cheerio Joe was envious of this cheerio. He wasnt cracked or broken and looked like he had taken a nice dip in Skim Milk. A world with Skim Milk? Nonperfect Cheerio Joe was jealous, thats for sure. The Perfect Cheerio introduced himself and coincidentally his name was Joe as well. What are the odds?\\n\\n\\nPerfect Cheerio Joe started to tell Nonperfect Cheerio Joe about all the fun and exciting things that Perfect Cheerio World has to offer. Perfect Cheerio Joe offered to be Nonperfect Cheerio Joes tour guide for the day. First things first, Perfect Cheerio Joe said, We must go get some breakfast!\\n\\nPerfect Cheerio Joe and Nonperfect Joe walked into a little café and went to the front of the line. The cashier politely told them that they had to wait at the back of the line. Wheres that? Nonperfect Cheerio Joe asked.\\n\\nGo five blocks down. Take three rights, and two lefts, and then six more rights. Then one more left and then youll reach the end of the line, said the cashier.\\n\\n\\nPerfect Cheerio Joe and Nonperfect Cheerio Joe obliged and waited on the long line to get their breakfast. Next, Perfect Cheerio Joe said that Nonperfect Cheerio Joe had to go to the National Cheerio Museum. Nonperfect Cheerio Joe loved museums so he happily agreed. When they arrived at the National Cheerio Museum, they first had to purchase tickets to see some exhibits. They walked up to the ticket booth where they were told to head to back of the line. Wheres that? Nonperfect Cheerio Joe asked.\\n\\n\\nGo five blocks down. Take three rights, and two lefts, and then six more rights. Then one more left and then youll reach the end of the line.\\n\\nAlthough the line was long, Nonperfect Cheerio Joe was ecstatic because he got to see the first Cheerio ever created. Perfect Cheerio Joe then recommended they go see a movie because Nonperfect Cheerio World doesnt have any movie theaters. Nonperfect Cheerio Joe picked the movie, Unrequited Love for a Honey Nut Cheerio. Even Cheerios love romantic comedies. The movie theater was gorgeous and Nonperfect Cheerio Joe was so happy until they had to buy tickets for the movie and they had to go to the back of the line. Wheres that? Nonperfect Cheerio Joe asked.\\n\\nGo five blocks down. Take three rights, and two lefts, and then six more rights. Then one more left and then youll reach the end of the line.\\n\\nOnce they were in the movie theater, Nonperfect Cheerio Joe knew that he couldnt have the full movie experience without popcorn. He quickly left the theater during the previews and went to buy some popcorn. He was told to head to the back of the line. These long lines were really starting to bother Nonperfect Cheerio Joe, but he knew he was only here for a day so he had to experience it all. Wheres the back of the line? Nonperfect Cheerio Joe asked.\\n\\nIt wraps around the theater, so head south on Strawberry Street. Then make two rights. Next walk two blocks down and make a left onto Grain Road, then youll be at the end of the line.\\n\\nNonperfect Cheerio Joe hoped the popcorn would be worth it. Just as he sat down in his seat with his popcorn the movie was beginning. I know what luck! Damn previews. After the movie was finished, Perfect Cheerio Joe recommended going to a party so that Nonperfect Cheerio Joe could meet a bunch of Perfect Cheerios. Nonperfect Cheerio Joe loved all Cheerios so he was pumped! When they arrived outside of the party they had to wait in line to enter. Nonperfect Cheerio Joe was getting a wee bit frustrated when he asked where the end of the line was.\\n\\nWalk 1.37 miles. Then when you get to the fork in the road take a right. Then you need to make one right, one left, one right, and one left. After that youll be at the end of the line.\\n\\nAlthough Nonperfect Cheerio Joe was exhausted by the time they got into the party he was still ready to dance the night away. Nonperfect Cheerio Joe and Perfect Cheerio Joe headed straight to the dance floor and boogied all night. Two hours in, Nonperfect Cheerio Joe got thirsty. Perfect Cheerio Joe mentioned that the punch at this place was the bomb dot com. Nonperfect Cheerio Joe decided that without punch he would probably pass out. After waiting all day on so many lines Nonperfect Cheerio Joe knew what to expect. He walked up to the Cheerio serving the punch and said, Wheres the punch line?\\n\\nThe server looked at him confused, There is no punch line.\\n\\nThe End', 'My children simply refuse to eat their vegetables.

As she enters, she sees her husband there, reading a magazine. He says, Hi darling, your parents have come to visit us, so I let them stay in our bedroom. Did you say hello?']\n"
